## Detect Your Android Device's Resolution in Pixels(px) and DiPs(dp)

Head over to the [release page](https://github.com/Septillion/Detect-Resolution/releases) for download. Also check out the sister project [Detect Resolution iOS](https://github.com/Septillion/Detect-Resolution-iOS)

If you would like to use the code:

- Copy DisplayCapabilities.java into your project
- The methods within are pretty self-explainatory.
